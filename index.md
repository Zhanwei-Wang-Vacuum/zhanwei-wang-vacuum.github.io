<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en) and [Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre](https://www.imec-int.com/en), working under the mentorship of Prof. [Bram Vanderborght](http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody/members/bram.htm). My research focuses on the self-healing materials, soft matter, and their interplay with fluid mechanics in the context of fabricating and actuating soft robots. I place a particular emphasis on advancing the physical intelligence and programmable behaviors in robotics.
## Research Interest:
- **Soft Robotics:** Design, fabrication, actuation, and control for soft robotics.
- **Additive Manufacturing:** Soft and multi-functional materials 3D printing.
- **Simulations:** Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
- **Microfluidics:** Microfluidic chips development and its potential for soft robots.
