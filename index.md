<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am a Postdoc researcher at [Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre](https://www.imec-int.com/en) and [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en), working under the supervision of Prof. [Bram Vanderborght](http://mech.vub.ac.be/multibody/members/bram.htm). My research focuses on the stimulus-responsive materials, soft matters, and their interplay with fluid mechanics in the context of designing and actuating soft robots. I place a particular emphasis on advancing the physical intelligence and programmable behaviors in robotics.
## Research Interest:
- **Soft Robotics:** Design, fabrication, actuation, and control for soft robotics.
- **Additive Manufacturing:** Soft and multi-functional materials 3D printing.
- **Simulations:** Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
- **Microfluidics:** Microfluidic chips development and its potential for soft robots.

## News:
- **IROS2025:**
 - Technical Session Chair of Soft Sensors and Actuators 2.
 - Best Oral Presentation at the Workshop Bio-Inspired Robotic Perception and Control: Bridging Centralized and Decentralized Intelligence.
 - Poster Presentation at the Workshop The SOFT frontier 2: practical applications in soft robotics.
 - Twice Oral Presentations at the technical session of Soft Sensors and Actuators.
